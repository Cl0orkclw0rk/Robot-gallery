# Robot-gallery
A gallery of my original robot designs, mostly designed for RoboCup Junior Australia.

## Featured Robots  
- **T418** – A sleek and efficient machine with a cutting-edge design.  
- **Jankpot** – A scrappy, unpredictable bot with a lot of personality.  
- **T4** – A refined evolution of previous models, blending form and function.  
- **Robobox** – A versatile, all-purpose robotic unit.  

## Usage
